## Task 2: Motivations
<!What will the application do?>
<!Who will use it?>
<!Why is this project of interest to you?>


In this project, I will build a connect 4 game and allow the player to see a history of their previously-played
games. 2 players will take turns placing coins in the grid, and when the game is over they can view
their previous boards with who won and what the final board looked like, as well as the proportion of wins for 
each player. 

This will therefore simply be a game made for 2 people in need of a distraction, with the desire to have the opportunity
to learn from their moves by keeping a record of their techniques. This ability to keep a record
of the games in an accessible manner is what drew me to this project, as I am frustrated at the lack of such features in
online versions of the game.


## Task 3: User Stories
<!--There is at least one user story that involves the user adding an X to a Y (e.g. adding an item to a to-do list),
where X and Y are classes that you will have to design yourself

Also note that in each of these sample applications, 
there is at least one user story that involves the user viewing a list of items-->
- As a user, I want to be able to add my coin to one of the columns of the game when it's my turn.
- As a user, I want to be able to add the just-finished game to my games history.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of the previous games played with the winner and the final board layout.
- As a user, I want to be able to withdraw from a game, making the other player win the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the proportion of games won by each player in the game history.

- As a user, I want to be able to choose to save my games history to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load a previous game history file if I want.
